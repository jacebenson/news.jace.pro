### Setup

We use Yarn as our package manager. To get the dependencies installed, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

### Fire it up

Get site started
```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Get Database started
```terminal
docker-compose -f postgres-docker.yml up
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.

Postgres will be availble on port 5432, and you can see the db content via adminer on port `http://localhost:8080`.
Postgres default username: postgres
Postgres default password: example
